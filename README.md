# Bitcoin Project
The project was undertaken as part of the Advanced Data Analysis 23/24 course in collaboration with a colleague. The objective was to analyze the Bitcoin dataset by creating a classifier model with KNN and implementing a clustering process with K-mean.

For this project, a blockchain can be seen as a list of blocks, and each block has a list of transactions.

The provided data files include a list of transactions performed in Bitcoin. The list of transactions is continuous and ordered in time, being a subset of all transactions performed in Bitcoin. A transaction transfers currency from one or more source addresses to one or more destination addresses.

The datasets are a transformation form the data provided at https://www.kaggle.com/shiheyingzhe/datasets.
